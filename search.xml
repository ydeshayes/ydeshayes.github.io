        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a senior developer, I’ve come to realize that one of the most critical skills in software development is the ability to effectively debug code. Over the years, I’ve found intriguing parallels between debugging and various concepts, from classic games to philosophical arguments. In this article, we’ll explore these connections, emphasizing the importance of a proper debug setup and advanced techniques that can elevate your debugging skills.</p><h2 id="The-Mastermind-Analogy"><a href="#The-Mastermind-Analogy" class="headerlink" title="The Mastermind Analogy"></a>The Mastermind Analogy</h2><p>Let’s start by comparing debugging to the classic game Mastermind. Both require strategy, patience, and a methodical approach:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Secret Code (Bug)</strong>: In Mastermind, you’re trying to uncover a hidden sequence. In debugging, you’re hunting for the root cause of unexpected behavior.</p></li><li><p><strong>Making Guesses (Hypotheses)</strong>: Mastermind players make strategic guesses. Developers form hypotheses about what might be causing the bug.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feedback (Debug Output)</strong>: In Mastermind, you receive feedback on the accuracy of your guess. In debugging, you gather information through various tools and techniques.</p></li><li><p><strong>Iterative Process</strong>: Both Mastermind and debugging involve multiple rounds of guessing and refining based on feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logical Deduction</strong>: Success in both requires careful analysis of available information to narrow down possibilities.</p></li></ol><h2 id="The-Importance-of-Debug-Setup"><a href="#The-Importance-of-Debug-Setup" class="headerlink" title="The Importance of Debug Setup"></a>The Importance of Debug Setup</h2><p>Just as a well-organized Mastermind board is crucial for gameplay, a proper debug setup is essential for efficient problem-solving in software development.</p><h3 id="1-Integrated-Development-Environment-IDE"><a href="#1-Integrated-Development-Environment-IDE" class="headerlink" title="1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)"></a>1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3><p>Choose an IDE with robust debugging features. Look for:</p><ul><li>Breakpoint support</li><li>Variable inspection</li><li>Step-through execution</li><li>Watch windows</li></ul><h3 id="2-Logging"><a href="#2-Logging" class="headerlink" title="2. Logging"></a>2. Logging</h3><p>Implement comprehensive logging in your application:</p><ul><li>Use different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)</li><li>Include contextual information (timestamps, function names, line numbers)</li><li>Consider using a logging framework for advanced features</li></ul><h3 id="3-Error-Handling"><a href="#3-Error-Handling" class="headerlink" title="3. Error Handling"></a>3. Error Handling</h3><p>Implement proper error handling mechanisms:</p><ul><li>Use try-catch blocks strategically</li><li>Create custom error classes for specific scenarios</li><li>Ensure errors bubble up with meaningful information</li></ul><h3 id="4-Version-Control"><a href="#4-Version-Control" class="headerlink" title="4. Version Control"></a>4. Version Control</h3><p>Utilize version control systems effectively:</p><ul><li>Make small, frequent commits</li><li>Use meaningful commit messages</li><li>Leverage branching strategies for isolating and testing fixes</li></ul><h2 id="Debugging-Techniques"><a href="#Debugging-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Debugging Techniques"></a>Debugging Techniques</h2><p>Now, let’s explore some debugging techniques, drawing parallels to Mastermind strategies:</p><h3 id="1-Reproduce-the-Issue-Setting-Up-the-Board"><a href="#1-Reproduce-the-Issue-Setting-Up-the-Board" class="headerlink" title="1.

Those computers were very popular, you could learn math, orthograph, geography etc… The screen was crappy, the sound too.</p><p>So now you are wondering, the title is <code>My first program</code>, you can’t write program with a kids computer right?</p><p>I still don’t really know why, but at the time<span id="more"></span>, some kid computers were capable of running a BASIC emulator. This is what my dad use to show me how to write my first program.<br>It is very blury because I was very young (and my dad don’t really remember either…), but I think this program was printing the alphabet in a loop.</p><p>When I discovered that, I remember that I was not playing any game anymore, I was just trying to program my alphabet loop again ang again because we did not have any floppy to save to (you needed to buy some proprietary stuff), so I was loosing everything everytime I shutdown the computer.</p><p>After some research, turns out this was a light version of BASIC that was on those computers, <code>PRE-BASIC 1.0</code>.
